# WinProm

WinProm is a Windows tool for calculating the topographic prominence
of mountains.  It was written by Edward Earl, a pioneer in prominence
research and calculation.

## Building the code

WinProm compiles with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.
You can download it for free from Microsoft's Web site.  Be sure to
install the Visual C++ compiler and the MFC libraries; these are not
installed by default.
